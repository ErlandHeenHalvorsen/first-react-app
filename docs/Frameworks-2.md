# JS FRAMEWORKS 2

## Components, Props, Events and State

### Components
- The building blocks of a React application.
- If made correctly it can be reused throughout the project.
- Lets devs break down complex ui into smaller and more managable parts.

There are two types of components.

#### Functional Components

- simple js functions that takes props as arguments and return jsx.
- they are lightweight and don't use class-based syntax.

#### Class Components
- Use ES6 classes and extend React.Component.
- They have their own **State**

### Why use components?

- Reusability, write it once and use troughout project
- Each Component handles it's own part oof the UI.
- It's maintainable, easy to update and debug.
- Composition, Components can be nested and used to create complex UI.
